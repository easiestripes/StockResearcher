I made this to be more efficient while researching different companies stock by not having to manually type in the ticker I want to look at into each webpage I use. It prompts the user for a stock ticker. Once entered, it will open a new browser window with all the webpages I personally use to research certain indicators of a company's stock.<br />
If you want to add any other websites to the program, modify the OpenWebsites.java 'webpages' array.
